# HTTP

Options related to the base support of HTTP requests by the server.

## Handler

Sets up all the handlers a request will potentially pass through.

* *default*: The full setup, that is middleware + static files + IDP + LDP.
* *simple*: A simpler setup in which the IDP is disabled.

## Middleware

A set of handlers that will always be run on all requests to add some metadata
and then pass the request along.

* *default*: The default setup with several handlers.

## Notifications

Determines how notifications should be sent out from the server when resources change.

* *disabled*: No notifications are sent out.
* *legacy-websocket*: Follows the legacy Solid WebSocket
  [specification](https://github.com/solid/solid-spec/blob/master/api-websockets.md).
* *websockets*: Follows the WebSocketSubscription2021
  [specification](https://solidproject.org/TR/websocket-subscription-2021).

## Server-Factory

The factory used to create the actual server object.

* *http*: A HTTP server.
* *https*: A HTTPS server.
* *https-no-cli-example*: An example of how to set up an HTTPS server
  by defining the key/cert paths directly in the config itself.

## Static

Support for static files that should be found at a specific path.

* *default*: The default handler with a favicon and css for the IDP.
  New entries can easily be added for new files.
