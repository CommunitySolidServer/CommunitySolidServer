# Util
Various utility related options.

## Auxiliary
Exports an object that contains a list of all auxiliary resources that need to be supported.
In case you create a new auxiliary strategy you can just add it to this list.
* *acl*: Default list with only support for acl auxiliary resources.
* *no-acl*: An empty list which can be added to.

## Identifiers
How identifiers should be interpreted.
This is mostly relevant when creating pods and/or using a file-based backend.
* *subdomain*: New pod identifier would be `http://alice.test.com/`.
  File path of `http://alice.test.com/foo` would be `/alice/foo`.
* *suffix*: New pod identifier would be `http://test.com/alice`.
  Requests to subdomain identifiers would be rejected.

## Index
This can be used to provide different behaviour for index files.
This is mostly relevant for user interfaces.
* *default*: No special support.
* *example*: An example of how this could be configured.
  If this is needed the best solution is usually to not import anything here
  and have the index setup in the root config.

## Logging
Which logger to use.
* *no-logging*: Disables all logging.
* *winston*: Uses the winston logger.

## Representation-conversion
Used for converting from one content type to another when needed.
When a new content type needs to be supported, this can be done by adding a corresponding converter
to the ChainedConverter list.
* *default*: The default conversion setup which supports most RDF formats.

## Resource-locker
Which locking mechanism to use to for example prevent 2 write simultaneous write requests.
* *debug-void*: No locking mechanism, does not prevent simultaneous read/writes.
* *memory*: Uses an in-memory locking mechanism.
* *redis*: Uses a Redis store for locking.

## Variables
Various variables used by other options.
These can usually be set through CLI parameters.
* *default*: The default list of variables.
