# Community Solid Server release notes

## v3.0.0
### New features
- The Identity Provider now uses the `webid` scope as required for Solid-OIDC.
- The `VoidLocker` can be used to disable locking for development/testing purposes. 
  This can be enabled by changing the `/config/util/resource-locker/` import to `debug-void.json`
- Added support for setting a quota on the server. See the `config/quota-file.json` config for an example.
- An official docker image is now built on each version tag and published at https://hub.docker.com/r/solidproject/community-server.
- Added support for N3 Patch.
- It is now possible to customize arguments to the `community-solid-server` command, 
  which enables passing custom variables to configurations and setting new default values.
- The AppRunner functions have changed to require Components.js variables. 
  This is important for anyone who starts the server from code.

### Configuration changes
You might need to make changes to your v2 configuration if you use a custom config.

The following changes pertain to the imports in the default configs:
- A new configuration option needs to be imported:
  - `/app/variables/default/json` contains everything related to parsing CLI arguments 
    and assigning values to variables.

The following changes are relevant for v2 custom configs that replaced certain features.
- Conversion has been simplified so most converters are part of the conversion chain:
  - `/util/representation-conversion/default.json`
- The IDP settings have changed to support the latest Solid-OIDC draft.
  - `/identity/handler/provider-factory/identity.json`
- Requests targeting the OIDC library now use a separate handler.
  - `/http/handler/default.json`
  - `/identity/handler/default.json`

### Interface changes
These changes are relevant if you wrote custom modules for the server that depend on existing interfaces.
- `TypedRepresentationConverter` function signatures changed 
  and base functionality moved to `BaseTypedRepresentationConverter`

## v2.0.0
### New features
- Pod owners always have Control access to resources stored in their Pod.
- The server now offers a one-time setup upon first boot.
  This can be accessed by going to `/setup`.
  Configurations with a persistent backend enforce setup before the server can be used,
  preventing unintended modifications in the backend.
  These have corresponding `*-no-setup.json` files where setup is disabled,
  so the pre-v2.0 behavior is still available.
- `ETag`, `Last-Modified`, `If-None-Match`, and related conditional headers are supported.
- `PATCH`ing containers is now supported.
- `PUT`/`POST` requests with empty bodies are supported.
- WebACL authorization supports groups.
- IDP components (registration, login, etc.) fully support JSON input and output.
- There is a new configuration `sparql-file-storage.json` to have a SPARQL backend with file storage.
  `sparql-file-storage.json`.
- A server can be set up to restrict access to IDP components using WebACL.
  A consequence of this is that IDP components are only accessible using a trailing slash.
  E.g., `/idp/register/` works, `/idp/register` will error.

### Configuration changes
You might need to make changes to your v1 configuration if you use a custom config.

The following changes pertain to the imports in the default configs:
- There are 2 new configuration options that for which a valid option needs to be imported:
  - `/app/setup` determines how and if setup should be enabled.
  - `/identity/access` determines if IDP access (e.g., registration) should be restricted
- The `/app/init/default.json` configuration no longer initializes the root container. 
  This behaviour has been moved to the other options for `/app/init`.
- `/ldp/permissions` changed to `/ldp/modes` and only has a default option now.

The following changes are relevant for v1 custom configs that replaced certain features.
The path indicates which JSON-LD files were impacted by the change.
- `IdentityProviderHttpHandler` and `InteractionRoute` arguments have changed substantially. 
  - `/identity/handler/default.json`
  - `/identity/handler/interaction/*`
  - `/identity/registration/*`.
- All internal storage is now stored in the `/.internal/` container. 
  - `/storage/key-value/resource-store.json`. 
- Patching related classes have changed. 
  - `/storage/middleware/stores/patching.json`.
- `BasicRequestParser` now needs a `conditionsParser` argument.
  - `/ldp/handler/components/request-parser.json`.
- `LinkTypeParser` has been renamed to `LinkRelParser` and now takes mappings as input. 
  - `/ldp/metadata-parser/*`
- `ComposedAuxiliaryStrategy` `isRootRequired` has been renamed to `requiredInRoot`. 
  - `/util/auxiliary/strategies/acl.json`.
- Many changes to authentication and authorization structure. 
  - Config `/ldp/authentication/*` and `/ldp/authorization/*`.
- All `HttpHandler`s have been changed. 
  - `/app/setup/handlers/setup.json`
  - `/http/handler/default.json`
  - `/identity/handler/default.json`
  - `/ldp/handler/default.json`.

## v1.1.0
### New features
- The `ConstantConverter` can now filter on media type using the `enabledMediaRanges` and `disabledMediaRanges` options. That way, the server can be configured to bypass a default UI when accessing images or PDF documents.

## v1.0.0
First release of the Community Solid Server.
