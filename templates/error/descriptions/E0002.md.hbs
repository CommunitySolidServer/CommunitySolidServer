# Please log in through an app
Logging in to a Solid Pod needs to happen via a Solid app.
<br>
It is not possible to use the login page directly.
If you are developing an app,
you can use a library such as [`solid-client-authn-js`](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn-js) to initiate an OIDC authentication flow.
