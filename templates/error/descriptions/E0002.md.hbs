# Please log in through an app
**To log in and access documents, you need to use a Solid app.**
<br>
This server provides secure storage,
but it is not a client app.
<br>
Choose one of the [Solid apps](https://solidproject.org/apps)
to log in and browse Pods.

If you're developing an app yourself,
use a library such as [`solid-client-authn-js`](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn-js)
<br>
to initiate an OIDC authentication flow.
