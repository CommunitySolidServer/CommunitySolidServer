### Requests to `{{ path }}` are not supported
The Community Solid Server received a request for `{{ path }}`, which is not configured.
Here are some things you can try to fix this:
 - Have you started the server with the right hostname?
 - If you are running the server behind a reverse proxy, did you set up the `Forwarded` header correctly?
