# Request received for an unsupported path
## This server appears to be misconfigured

**A Community Solid Server needs to be assigned a specific URL**,
<br>
so it knows how to handle every incoming request.

The request you made arrived at the server as `{{ path }}`,
which is a URL not assigned to it.
<br>
As such, the server cannot respond correctly
until its configuration is changed.

## Fixing the server configuration
**To solve this problem, the server administrator needs to fix the configuration.**
<br>
The problem is typically one of these:

1. The server was started with **the wrong hostname.**
    - Use the `--baseUrl` (or `-b`) option to set the base URL.  
      Example: `community-solid-server --baseUrl https://mydomain.example/`

2. A **reverse proxy** running in front of the server passes the wrong headers.
    - Set up the [`Forwarded` header](https://solidproject.org/self-hosting/css/nginx)
      to pass the correct URL on to the server.
