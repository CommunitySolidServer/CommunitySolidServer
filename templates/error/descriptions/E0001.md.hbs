# Request received for an unsupported path
## This server appears to be misconfigured

**A Community Solid Server needs to be assigned a specific URL**,
<br>
so it knows how to handle every incoming request.

The request you made arrived at the server as `{{ path }}`,
which is a URL not assigned to it.
<br>
As such, the server cannot respond correctly
until its configuration is changed.

## Fixing the server configuration
**To solve this problem, the server administrator needs to fix the configuration.**
<br>
The problem is typically one of these:

1. The server was started with **the wrong hostname.**
    - Use the `--baseUrl` (or `-b`) option to set the base URL.
      Example: `community-solid-server --baseUrl https://mydomain.example/`

2. A **reverse proxy** running in front of the server passes the wrong headers.
    - Set up the [`Forwarded` header](https://solidproject.org/self-hosting/css/nginx)
      to pass the correct URL on to the server.

## Circumventing this for development

For development reasons, it can be easier to temporarily allow requests from multiple host locations.
This can be done by adding the following lines to your server configuration,
causing the server to always assume the value of the `host` header is defined 
by the `--baseUrl` parameter.

```json
{
  "@id": "urn:solid-server:default:TargetExtractor",
  "OriginalUrlExtractor:_args_fixedBaseUrl": { "@id": "urn:solid-server:default:variable:baseUrl" }
},
{
  "@id": "urn:solid-server:default:DPoPUrlExtractor",
  "OriginalUrlExtractor:_args_fixedBaseUrl": { "@id": "urn:solid-server:default:variable:baseUrl" }
}
```
