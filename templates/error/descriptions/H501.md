# Not implemented
You are trying to use a feature that the server does not implement (yet).

Possible causes include:
- something is misconfigured on the server side
- the behavior you are trying to access is not described by the Solid specifications

If you think this behavior should be supported,
you can [submit a bug report](https://github.com/solid/community-server/issues/new).
