# Authenticating with unknown client
You are trying to log in to an application,
but we can't proceed
because the app is using invalid settings.

To force the app to send us the right details,
delete the local storage in your browser for the site that sent you here.
Based on the data the app sent us,
this is probably `{{ redirect_uri }}`.

## Detailed error information
We received a request from a client with ID `{{ client_id }}`,
but this client is not registered with the server.

Probably,
this client was registered with the server in the past,
but it is no longer recognized
because some internal server data was removed.
Your data is still safe;
we just don't recognize the app's previous authentication anymore.

Because your browser still has the old authentication settings stored,
it tries to use them instead of setting up new ones.
By clearing those settings,
the application should automatically create a new client,
allowing you to log in again.
