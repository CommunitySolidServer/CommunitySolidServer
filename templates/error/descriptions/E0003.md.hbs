# Trying to authenticate an unknown client

The server received a request from a client with ID **{{ client_id }}**,
but this client is not registered with the server.

This is quite often caused by the server data being wiped,
thereby forgetting all clients.
After clients register they often cache this data in the browser
and automatically try to reconnect to the server,
but since the server no longer knows the client this request is rejected.

The only solution to this problem is to remove the data cached by the client.
This can be done by clearing the cookies and cache in your browser for that specific URL.
After succes, this client wanted the server to redirect you to <{{ redirect_uri }}>,
so that is probably the site for which you need to remove your browser data.
