**An open and modular implementation of the
[Solid](https://solidproject.org/)
[specifications](https://solid.github.io/specification/)**

- Community Solid Server is open software
to provide people with their own Solid Pod.

- It will give developers an environment
to create and test new Solid applications.

- Its modular architecture allows
trying out new ideas on the server side
and thereby shape the future of Solid.

## Running the server

### Installing and running locally
```shell
npm install -g @solid/community-server
community-solid-server # add parameters if needed
```

### Installing and running from source
```shell
npm ci
npm start -- # add parameters if needed
```

### Running via Docker
```shell
# Build the Docker image
docker build --rm -f Dockerfile -t css:latest .
# Run the image against your `~/Solid` directory on `http://localhost:3000`
docker run --rm -v ~/Solid:/data -p 3000:3000 -it css:latest
# Use alternative built-in configurations
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 -it css:latest -c config/default.json
# Use your own configuration mapped to the right directory
docker run --rm -v ~/solid-config:/config -p 3000:3000 -it css:latest -c /config/my-config.json
```

## Configuring the server
Community Solid Server (CSS) uses
[ComponentJS](https://componentsjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to manage all
configuration for the server. There are a variety of configuration files for
common use cases in the `config` folder.

Additional recipes for configuring and deploying the server can be found at [solid/community-server-recipes](https://github.com/solid/community-server-recipes).

## Using the identity provider

You can register and/or create a pod by going to `/idp/register` after starting the server.
The input you need to provide depends on the chosen options,
as is indicated next to the text fields.
After submitting, you will get a summary of everything that was created.
Below are descriptions of the 3 available options.

### 1. Create new WebID
Enabling this option will create a new WebID to be used for authentication.
Since a WebID needs to be stored and registered somewhere to be used,
this option also requires options 2 & 3 below to be enabled.

In case you do not choose this option,
you will have to provide your own WebID.
The server will then ask to verify that you are the owner of that WebID
by adding a specific token to it.

### 2. Register your WebID with the IDP
This allows you to authenticate with your WebID using this server.
After doing this you can use a client such as `@inrupt/solid-client-authn-js`
to log in with the chosen email/password combination and this server as issuer.
In case you are using an external WebID, 
it is important to add the correct `solid:oidcIssuer` triple to your profile after registering.

### 3. Create a new pod
Creates a new Solid pod. 
The location of the pod will be determined by the chosen pod name.
In case a WebID is also being created, it will be located inside this pod.

## Developing server code
The [üìó¬†API documentation](https://solid.github.io/community-server/docs/) and
the [üìê¬†architectural diagram](https://rubenverborgh.github.io/solid-server-architecture/solid-architecture-v1-3-0.pdf)
can help you find your way.

If you want to help out with the development of this server,
have a look at the [üìì¬†developer notes](guides/developer-notes.md) and
[üõ†Ô∏è¬†good first issues](https://github.com/solid/community-server/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
