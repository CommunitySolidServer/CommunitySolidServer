These are described here.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/core/#handlers","title":"Handlers","text":"<p>A very important building block that gets reused in many places is the <code>AsyncHandler</code>. The idea is that a handler has 2 important functions. <code>canHandle</code> determines if this class is capable of correctly handling the request, and throws an error if it can not. For example, a class that converts JSON-LD to turtle can handle all requests containing JSON-LD data, but does not know what to do with a request that contains a JPEG. The second function is <code>handle</code> where the class executes on the input data and returns the result. If an error gets thrown here it means there is an issue with the input. For example, if the input data claims to be JSON-LD but is actually not.</p> <p>The power of using this interface really shines when using certain utility classes. The one we use the most is the <code>WaterfallHandler</code>, which takes as input a list of handlers of the same type. The input and output of a <code>WaterfallHandler</code> is the same as those of its inputs, meaning it can be used in the same places. When doing a <code>canHandle</code> call, it will iterate over all its input handlers to find the first one where the <code>canHandle</code> call succeeds, and when calling <code>handle</code> it will return the result of that specific handler. This allows us to chain together many handlers that each have their specific niche, such as handler that each support a specific HTTP method (GET/PUT/POST/etc.), or handlers that only take requests targeting a specific subset of URLs. To the parent class it will look like it has a handler that supports all methods, while in practice it will be a <code>WaterfallHandler</code> containing all these separate handlers.</p> <p>Some other utility classes are the <code>ParallelHandler</code> that runs all handlers simultaneously, and the <code>SequenceHandler</code> that runs all of them one after the other. Since multiple handlers are executed here, these only work for handlers that have no output.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/core/#streams","title":"Streams","text":"<p>Almost all data is handled in a streaming fashion. This allows us to work with very large resources without having to fully load them in memory, a client could be reading data that is being returned by the server while the server is still reading the file. Internally this means we are mostly handling data as <code>Readable</code> objects. We actually use <code>Guarded&lt;Readable&gt;</code> which is an internal format we created to help us with error handling. Such streams can be created using utility functions such as <code>guardStream</code> and <code>guardedStreamFrom</code>. Similarly, we have a <code>pipeSafely</code> to pipe streams in such a way that also helps with errors.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/dependency-injection/","title":"Dependency injection","text":"<p>The community server uses the dependency injection framework Components.js to link all class instances together, and uses Components-Generator.js to automatically generate the necessary description configurations of all classes. This framework allows us to configure our components in a JSON file. The advantage of this is that changing the configuration of components does not require any changes to the code, as one can just change the default configuration file, or provide a custom configuration file.</p> <p>More information can be found in the Components.js documentation, but a summarized overview can be found below.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/dependency-injection/#component-files","title":"Component files","text":"<p>Components.js requires a component file for every class you might want to instantiate. Fortunately those get generated automatically by Components-Generator.js. Calling <code>npm run build</code> will call the generator and generate those JSON-LD files in the <code>dist</code> folder.

This must be a TypeScript class name that is exported via <code>index.ts</code>.</li> </ul> <p>As you can see from the constructor, the other fields are direct mappings from the constructor parameters. <code>source</code> references another object, which we refer to using its identifier <code>urn:solid-server:default:ResourceStore</code>. <code>baseUrl</code> is just a string, but here we use a variable that was set before calling Components.js which is why it also references an <code>@id</code>. These variables are set when starting up the server, based on the command line parameters.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/overview/","title":"Architecture overview","text":"<p>The initial architecture document the project was started from can be found here. Many things have been added since the original inception of the project, but the core ideas within that document are still valid.</p> <p>As can be seen from the architecture, an important idea is the modularity of all components. No actual implementations are defined there, only their interfaces. Making all the components independent of each other in such a way provides us with an enormous flexibility: they can all be replaced by a different implementation, without impacting anything else. This is how we can provide many different configurations for the server, and why it is impossible to provide ready solutions for all possible combinations.</p>"},{"location":"architecture/overview/#architecture-diagrams","title":"Architecture diagrams","text":"<p>Having a modular architecture makes it more difficult to give a complete architecture overview. We will limit ourselves to the more commonly used default configurations we provide, and in certain cases we might give examples of what differences there are based on what configurations are being imported.</p> <p>To do this we will make use of architecture diagrams.
